= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://globaltrustapi-env.eba-dqd9nmbk.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/:

== Get getfacilities API
.request
include::{snippets}/testCSVGetFacilities/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/testCSVGetFacilities/http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
